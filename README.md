### How To Play:

Stack blocks in order to form lines that get cleared away. 
Survive as long as possible avoiding the blocks stacking 
to the top of the grid.

       --> Singleplayer: Try to clear as many lines as possible

       --> Multiplayer: Send garbage to opponents by clearing lines
			 (more at once sends more garbage). 
		          Be the last one standing!

    --> Enter "start" as id or IP in order to activate singleplayer mode
    --> Failed connection to server results in singleplayer mode
